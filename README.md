This was my submission for the "Winter Melon Jam 2023", with a theme of "charm"!

Heavily inspired by Fruit Ninja, this game sees you working as an elf in Santa's Sweatshop. Your purpose is to sort gifts by colour in a variety of gamemodes.

I used https://p5js.org/ as my engine for this contest, which is a JavaScript library. All the art for this game was made by me with pixilart.com. The only things that weren't made by me are the song ("It's Christmas!" by KPM), and the sound effects.

The code which I wrote is in "sketch.js", all the other scripts are part of the p5 library.

Under Version History, I have the original jam build, and (I will have) the new updated build.
