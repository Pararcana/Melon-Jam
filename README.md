This was my submission for the "Winter Melon Jam 2023", with a theme of "charm"!

Heavily inspired by Fruit Ninja, this game sees you working as an elf in Santa's Sweatshop. Your purpose is to sort gifts by colour in a variety of gamemodes.

I used p5.js as my engine for this contest, which is a JavaScript library. All the art for this game was made by me with [pixilart.com](pixilart.com). The only things that weren't made by me are the song ("It's Christmas!" by KPM), and the sound effects.

The code which I wrote is in "sketch.js", all the other scripts are part of the p5 library.
